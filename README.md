## Description

Assignment #01: Code Refactor for Horiseon Marketing Agency

The motivation behind this refactor was to update the Horiseon Marketing Agency website to follow modern accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines with semantic HTML.

In doing this excersise, the biggest takeaway was how to take a complex and seemingly overwhelming task and approach it in a targeted, step-by-step approach. Another key takeaway is that this refactoring is a common task for front-end and junior developers, so practicing this early will help build the skills to take on these kind of jobs in the industry.
